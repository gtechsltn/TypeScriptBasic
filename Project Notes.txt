Introduction: TMP
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain javascript.

TypeScript gets more and more popular in the Front-end environment. Nowadays,

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript which primarily provides optional 
static typing, classes and interfaces. One of the big benefits 
is to enable IDEs to provide a richer environment 
for spotting common errors as you type the code.


JavaScript is dynamically typed. This means JavaScript does not know what type a variable is until it is actually instantiated at run-time. This also means that it may be too late. TypeScript adds type support to JavaScript. Bugs that are caused by false assumptions of some variable being of a certain type can be completely eradicated if you play your cards right (how strict you type your code or if you type your code at all is up to you).
